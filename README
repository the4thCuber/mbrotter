Mbrotter v0.1.1 (17 Sep 2023)

This program generates a series of images that then is converted to video.
The images are successive frames of the Mandelbrot Set.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set | Description of the Mandelbrot Set]

Dependencies:
*a C compiler to compile from source (gcc is specified in the makefile)
*ffmpeg (you could potentially edit some parts of the code to not use
	ffmpeg if it is not available on your machine)
*make

Editing configurations:
    In config.h, all the computation-specific options are #defined. Edit config.h
to change these options. The options for rendering are in the file zoom.sh.
    Rshift/gshift/bshift: Control the increments for the R, G, and B components
of the palette. They should be around 1-10, depending on the number of iterations
and how far of a zoom you are doing, and should be coprime and unequal unless
repetitive coloring is desired (e.g. 3.7, 4.1, and 4.3)
Go to the below address to find more helpful definitions of some of the below terms. 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set]
    Bailout: How far to compute the pixel before "giving up" on it. Mathematically,
4 is the optimal setting, but in practice a higher number is needed to improve and
smooth the coloring. Default value is 400.
    Maxperiod: Periodicity checking. Set to maxloop to turn off periodicity checking.
Default value is 25, turn off if there aren't many large black areas in the picture
    Iterscaling: Scale palette to this power of log(iter), controls width of "color bands".
Value of 1 provides least overhead, 0 corresponds to a uniform coloring. Values above 
1 provide more visible bands and transitions between the colors, especially with large 
values for rgbshifts. Default value is 3/4.
    zoom.sh settings:
    Max_loop: How far to iterate points. For very short zooms, it shouldn't need to go
above 500-5k, but for farther zooms, it could be necessary to go as high as 5m-50m.
Decrease this value to shorten computing time, increase it to get more detail in the
black areas. Default value is 4000.
    Width/height of generated images.
    Xcenter/ycenter: Center the program will zoom into. Use an online explorer to find a
good value, should stay in the range ([-2,.5],[-1,1]).
    Num_frames: Number of frames. 3000-9000 gives a video length of 1:40-5:00 at 30fps.
    Zoom_i/zoom_f: intial and final zoom levels, in log base 10 form. 
    Note: carefully pick the framerate, number of frames, and initial/final zoom so that
the zooming action in the video is not too slow or too fast.
